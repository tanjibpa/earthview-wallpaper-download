# Earthview Wallpaper Downloader
I love the wallpapers of [earthview.withgoogle.com]. They are great as desktop wallpaper. So I wrote a script to parse the download url of wallpaper from the site and download the wallpaper and set that as desktop wallpaper. ðŸ˜ƒ

First clone this repo and give permission to `run.sh` file.
```sh
$ chmod a+x run.sh
```
Then add `run.sh` to the crontab to change the wallpaper on whatever time duration you want.
```sh
crontab -e
```
This will open an editor, add cron command to the editor, then save and exit.
```
0 * * * * /path/to/run.sh
```
This command will run `run.sh` hourly.
